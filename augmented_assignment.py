# augmented assignment

# Augmented assignment is a shorthand syntax for updating the value of a variable.
# It is also known as in-place assignment.

# The following table shows the augmented assignment operators in Python:

# Operator	Example	Equivalent
# +=	x += 5	x = x + 5
# -=	x -= 5	x = x - 5
# *=	x *= 5	x = x * 5
# /=	x /= 5	x = x / 5


# Example: Augmented Assignment
x = 5
x += 3

print(x) # 8

x -= 3
print(x) # 5

x *= 3
print(x) # 15

x /= 3
print(x) # 5.0

# The augmented assignment operators are faster than the normal arithmetic operators.
